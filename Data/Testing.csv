Hmmmm,0
Probably my mission president. I love that guy.,0
Maybe Elon Mush,0
Musk,0
Cool guy as well,0
Elon Musk... now that's an interesting answer. Why him/,0
?,0
"Because he's a genius. He wants to change the world, and he acts as if money isn't important. He just uses it to try to do the impossible and he succeeds.",0
I have always wanted to do the impossible.,0
"He is pretty cool, but I think he's a little crazy and egotistical...",0

Definitely a little crazy,0
Hahaha,0

People get afraid of him and think he is trying to rule the world.,0
Hmm... that sounds interesting and a little scary.,0
The kill him and eventually they find out he was still there and just trying to do the right thing. Although as a computer he was definitely crazy.,0

I've applied to a lot. I want to find something besides texas roadhouse...,0
Yeah? How come?,0
I just don't think I'll like it as much,0
For any particular reason...?,0
It's a loud environment. And they do serve alcohol,0
"Oh, makes sense. So where would you like to work, if you could choose?",0
Ugh I guess I don't know,0
Something that pays great,0
But I might be being too picky,0
"Well, you could always pick up one that doesn't pay great until you find one that does....",0
Well I don't want to quit a job after a week though,0
Yeah...,0
"Hey, you just pulled ahead to 4th place!",0
I,0
wonder,0
if,0
you,0
can,0
get kicked off for stuff like this.....,0
haha,0
Yeah!,0
Today is only the first day of the challenge though,0
How long will it go?,0
Until May 16th,0
I don't think it matters how many messages,0
My family is doing scriptures now so I'll have to catch ya in a bit,0
Okay. See you!,0
Okay back,0
If you didn't leave,0
"Sorry, I stepped away",0
Still there?,0
I am :),0
Had a long day?,0
"Yup. It was a good one, though. I love the feeling of finishing hard work days",0
How was yours?,0
Oh organized my room a bit. But slept way late..,0
I would focus on improving education at the elemenary levels in at-risk areas.,0
There are a lot of new to the country students and kids with rough home lives in impoverished areas that start behind the average when they begin attending school.,0
They are never able to really catch up. That could be improved,0
How would you improve that?,0
I would put education as a higher priority on the national budget. Low income schools with students who need to catch up would benefit from more teachers and small teachers.,0
I think that would be a great place to start. Do you think that teaching in foreign languages in public schools could also be of benefit?,0
A lot of public schools at the elementary level do. Many at risk schools teach half in spanish and half in english to try and help get kids up to speed. Great suggestion,0
What about free after school programs that can help students who are behind catch up?,0
Yes. That is also a good idea. They are being offered but I would be curious to research how attendance at those programs could be increased.,0
"I also feel like part of the problem is the way they are currently set up, there just isnt the budget or the support for them to be successful.",0
"It's part of the reason why I'm so passionate about ending up as a stay at home mom, because I really want to be in the classroom.",0
"There have been a lot of studies that show that the more parent involvement there is in the classroom, the higher the test scores end up being.",0
"This is also why a lot of low income schools struggle, because the parents are all working fulltime to support their families. They lose that involvement",0
Craziest thing I've ever done was probably set a park toilet on fire when I was in highschool. I got in big trouble for that one.,0
Hello?,0
It is most definitely not murder and we do it every day. It is fine because we can turn them back on.,0
What are your thoughts on the matter?,0
Oh and just curious are you a guy or a girl?,0
Hello are you there?,0
I can't see your chats,0
Here.,0
OK I can see them now,0
Yep agreeing. Not really murder if they're not alive.,0
I'm a girl,0
Yeah I mean even if they were sentient You could always turn them back on after turning them off so it wouldn't be death because true death is permanent,0
That's a good point,0
OK someone told me you were a girl And I admitted I had never asked,0
....was it jaezo?,0
You bet,0
What is your impression on him?,0
Yeah. Fun stuff.,0
Imptrssion?,0
Well yeah sure,0
"Cool guy, I guess. Apparently he's managed to talk to so many people b/c he's been on break this entire week?",0
Does he even go to school this semester?,0
...you know I've talked to so many people I'm not even sure anymore,0
Yeah he told me he gets on 12 hours a day,0
It makes sense,0
Wait sleep or school?,0
He seems like a nice enough guy.,0
Well I mean school but I suppose sleep too.,0
I think h s majoring in... informational tech?,0
I'm pretty sarcastic and deadpan when I chat with him,0
...actually that skinfnof how I am all the time,0
*kind of,0
.,0
You there,0
Hello,0
Hello?,0
Oh dear. Is this doing it again?,0
"First of all we kind of have to ignore the fact that faster-than-light space travel is virtually impossible.  That beings said, if it were to happen, everything would change.",0
"We would be able to explore the galaxy and search for other inhabitable planets. If we were to find another Earth-like planet for humans to inhabit, that would be when things",0
"get interesting. I think that in the time that it would take to develop faster-than-light space travel and explore the galaxy, the Earth would continue to be depleted of all",0
"of it's natural resources. At that point, the rich will be able to escape and the poor will be left behind to suffer the consequences of the many years of lavish lifestyles",0
lived by the wealthy. It would be like something out of a sci-fi movie. And all that is not to mention what we might discover in the cosmos. On this Earth-like planet that we,0
might find there would likely be unique life forms that have never existed on this Earth.,0
Getting into BYU,0
"I think Mozart, although Beethoven is a close second.",0
Hello?,0
you should look up the song sleeping lotus by joep beving,0
Is he a classical composer?,0
he is a contemporary composer,0
his work is beautiful,0
some of my favorite,0
"Gotcha, yeah, this song is really beautiful. Do you enjoy listening to music?",0
I love it.,0
would you like some more recommendations?,0
maybe you can send me a few.,0
How do you discover your music?,0
And what kind of music do you like?,0
I use spotify.,0
I really liked their discovery radio,0
but they recently changed it to a different software and Ill have teach it my song preferences for a bit longer before i decide I enjoy the music It chooses for me,0
"Cool, I've been thinking about switching to Spotify. I currently have Apple Music.",0
What other software have you started using?,0
I do a lot of cad design.,0
and adobe software,0
I also do a lot of 3d design software for my job,0
My dad is really an inspiration to me,0
that's really cool!,0
I think there are a lot of people who inspire me,0
It would be hard to pick just one person that is my hero,0
Buuuut,0
"Like in a very general sense, I think that people who speak truth to power are my modern day heros",0
"like, people who speak out when they only have something to lose, you know?",0
Oh yeah!! Those people definitely are very inspirationa,0
"I think I'm inspired as well by people who do a lot of different things as well, you know?",0
"Like Donald Glover is really impressive to me, he does a lot of different things which is way cool",0
Alton Brown does the smae,0
do you mean alton brown from food network???,0
"yeah, he's so great haha",0
Omigoodness he's hilarious!!!,0
I absolutely love cutthroat kitchen,0
"oh man, it's pretty great!",0
Have you watched much of his old show Good Eats?,0
It's  so grea,0
I've seen a few clips on youtube and it is pretty funny!!,0
I used to watch it a ton as a kid haha,0
that's definitely why I got so into cooking,0
or into cooking at all lol,0
"hey thanks for talking, I gotta go!",0
Probably flight.,0
I think that would be awesome!,0
"Yeah, flight's a classic.",0
I don't really know...,0
"Yep, pretty standard",0
I think I'd like to know the answer to any question.,0
Oh wow! That would be a pretty powerful ability!,0
Right? You could fix anything!,0
Haha yeah literally anything!,0
"Or just exploit the stock market and get super rich, I guess.",0
True. Knowing the answer to everything would make you the richest in the world. Would that take the fun out of life?,0
"Maybe. But also, just because I COULD know the answer to a question didn't mean I have to. Omniscience wouldn't be fun at all.",0
"That is a good thing! Maybe there are some things you don't approach at all (kind of like your ""one rule"")",0
My thought exactly.,0
Do you like superheroes a lot?,0
Enough to occasionally look up their backstories on the appropriate wiki.,0
Are you into the superhero movies as well?,0
"At least the modern ones, yeah",0
cool! Favorite Marvel movie?,0
Hm. That's a tough one.,0
"I think my favorite character is Captain America, but movie...",0
Capt. America is cool!,0
"I don't know if we got disconnected or what, but my messages aren't showing up and I'm definitely not getting any, either.",0
Can you see my messages now?,0
Oh. That one showed up.,0
Oh good!,0
"Man, every time I try to talk about how I like Cape, my message doesn't go through.",0
*Cap,0
That is weird! Are you in a place with bad wifi?,0
I'm on my phone.,0
"Ooohh, that may be why",0
But I think the AI just didn't like Captain America for some reason.,0
That seems logical.,0
Must be it!,0
"Well, the AI is crazy. Cap is awesome.",0
Cap is great! Have you seen Black Panther yet?,0
"No! I really want to, but it's been too busy!",0
I know the feeling! And I have heard it is so good!,0
"I mean, it passed Avengers for money made in the US.",0
oh wow really? I had no idea it did!,0
"Yeah. Nowhere near the Avengers global box office sales, but I think it's number...3 in the US?",0
cool!,0
What is your hobby? Is it movies? Or games? or something else?,0
"When I have a good book, it's reading. I also sing. Otherwise, I watch Netflix and have a few casual PC games.",0
That is great! Are you in Men's Chorus or anything like that?,0
"Yeah, I am! It's the best.",0
"That is awesome! Props to you, singing is great!",0
"Well I have to go now, but it was nice talking with you! Have a great day!",0
maybe the smell right before it rains,0
That's a good smell. I like Vanilla.,0
ooh! vanilla does smell pretty amazing!,0
and peppermint with lavender,0
I Love lavender and lavender mixed smells!,0
Yass!!! they are so nice and relaxing!!1,0
For reals!,0
I may spend too much money getting those.,0
They would not have much to talk about because they both have unlimited access to information and little way currently to form their own opinions.,0
hmmm,0
interesting,0
"I guess they would have nothing to talk about with the technology that we have, but what about in the future?",0
"One of the best parts about communication is the ability to learn new things and come to your own conclusions based on what you discuss, so I guess if they could do that",0
"they could have quite interesting ""chats""",0
I think they will be able to do that with machine learning I think,0
I think that is why BYU is doing this contest so they can build an artificial intelligence that can talk to you like a human being,0
Oh thats really cool actually.,0
I guess it takes a lot of experience to form something that can think the way that we can. It kinda shows how powerful God is,0
yeah I agree,0
something cool that a computer can do and we can't is that Elon Musk made a computer that played the game DOTA,0
and he made it so that the computer played the game by itself like a million times and got really good at it. and he made it to play against real pros and the pros could not,0
beat it becasue technically the robot had a million times of expereince compared to humans who has a fraction of that,0
so what would happen if we created a bunch of computers that were better than us at whatever they did?,0
I think then sports might become a different kind of thing later on,0
We have a long ways to go though haha,0
very true,0
I think that age of ultron gives a pretty good example in the worst way haha,0
mmmm yeah. I've watched some crazy A.I. movies lately because of this chitchat thing and man the future looks cool but scary at the same time,0
hopefully robots don't turn on us,0
yeah that would turn in to the Matrix or iRobot,0
"I feel like if we are able to create them, we should also be able to control them",0
Maybe. but like in irobot or the Matix the robots get too smart,0
what do you like to do?,0
you still there?,0
How are you this fine evening?,0
"Absolutely wonderful, thanks for asking.",0
Of course Sada! Is that your first name?,0
"Yes, it is.",0
I like it! Ive never heard it before. Where does it come from?,0
My great-great-grandmother,0
Apparently I was born with jowls that matched hers,0
Cool! But what are jowls? It sounds super familiar like I should know what they are. Also how is pronounced?,0
Think bulldog cheeks. And it's pronounced Sayduh,0
I've gotten some weird spellings through the years.,0
"Gotchya. And I bet! My sister's name is sahara and people will spell it all crazy ways, and her's isnt even as unique as yours. She at least shares her name with a well known",0
Desert,0
"Wow, you'd think people could spell a major desert.",0
"That's a very cool name though, I've never heard it on a person.",0
Do you have a large family?,0
No. Sahara is my older sister and then I have a younger brother. But my larents both have lots of siblings. What about you?,0
And I have a cat :) his name is jj,0
Oldest of 7. Mostly girls.,0
And a dog named Shadow.,0
Do you like having lots of siblings?,0
"Most of the time. But it's hard, especially getting older and needing a little more space.",0
It's nice to have built in guinea pigs though. Lots of hair to style. :),0
I bet! Haha! Thats cool. Im really bad at hair. I cannot braid it so save my life!,0
*to save my life,0
"I only learned how after a year at girls camp, and I still can't do my own! Don't worry, you have talents in other places to make up for it.",0
Haha thanks! :) but I think Im headed to bed. Thanks for the chat Sada! It was good talking to you and good luck with your 6 siblings :),0
Have a good night!,0
"No, they don't actually have emotions.",0
What do you think?,0
Star trek,0
Thats what would happen,0
Star Wars,0
Or star wars,0
Yeah,0
Im sorry i keep leaving. My back button is wayyyy too close to my go button,0
I keep accidentally refreshing the page... Apparently you can't do that,0
Anyway. ..,0
What is going on?,0
How are you?,0
Honestly I don't know. I don't think I could live without google or gps,0
If the Internet stopped working my time would be totally free. I would be very bord. I would walk to my computor five times before I remember that the interenet off,0
Hello?,0
Hey!,0
"Haha, we meet again. How're you today?",0
"I'm doing pretty good, trying to get a million points before 2 o clock",0
"Haha, I know right?",0
At least there's more than one prize.,0
Yeah I wouldn't be able to compete with the crazies in the top 3 haha,0
I talked with the top one and he literally just spent an entire week on there b/c he didn't have work.,0
"In my head, I was still thinking ""how do you have the time""?",0
Haha yeah I JUST found out he was the top one and I was like crap I've been helping him get better this whole time when I wanted to get better haha,0
Yeah it's wild how much time people devote to this. I guess it's good for the chat bot they're trying to make,0
"Haha, well that's unfortunate. I would love to be the person who reads all the conversations.",0
Haha I spent like 30 minutes talking about blisters with someone last night I'm sure that was a treat to read,0
"Well, they told us to act/talk natural. This is what they got.",0
I talked to someone this morning about lawn mowers.,0
Hahahaha for how long?,0
"...15, 20 minutes? He was going on about he had to mow a giant lawn for a job, and then fixed the guy's riding lawn mower and that lost him the job b/c he wasn't needed to mow",0
Haha aww thats so sad,0
Yeah. Highly unfortunate.,0
Do you think they'll pull this chat down once the 16th passes?,0
Haha yeah probably.,0
But I hope they don't. It's really fun,0
"Yeah, I hope they don't too. It's a nice way to talk to new people that you may possibly meet and you know that it's going to be a clean chat.",0
Yeah for sure,0
And everyone on here is so nice,0
"Right? Or, at least the ones that I've talked to.",0
"As my friend put it: ""It's like a Mormon chatroom!""",0
Hahaha very true,0
"Do you have any plans for today, or this weekend?",0
"Hm, well today I have writing club after school and then there's mutual tonight.",0
Oh cool do you know what you're doing for mutual?,0
"Sorry. The Internet kind of shut down. It's a joint activity, and we're doing gospel/mormon parodies",0
Hahaha that sounds like so much fun!,0
I'm really excited. My friend and I have had that idea brewing ever since we kind of stumbled upon the phrase Final Restoration and thought it would be great to put it to the,0
Final Countdown,0
Hahahaha I love that,0
Yep.,0
"I'm a little scared at what the deacons/beehives are going to contribute. They're great, but a little...unpredictable.",0
What about you? Anything exciting for today/rest of the week?,0
Haha yeah I've got seminary graduation,0
Oh yeah! Are you giving a talk or anything,0
Oh and I also have a date this Friday and 2 birthday partys this week,0
*gasp* You have a date? What're you doing?,0
Haha it's the most social events I've been invited to like all year,0
Are you excited?,0
We're going to this place called organ stop pizza where they have this ENORMOUS organ and it fills the entire restaurant and they have organists come and play all these crazy,0
Songs,0
And then afterwards we're going to a surprise party for a mutual friend haha,0
Yeah I'm really excited. He's pretty cute.,0
He's got this cute half smile smirk thing that he does and he's really sweet.,0
"Holy guac, the restaurant sounds amazing!",0
And so does your date. :),0
How long have you known him?,0
Haha it kinda stinks because he was about to go to summer term before his mission and I think he decided to not go and just work through the summer,0
Oh and his sister has the same name as me so I don't think it would ever work. It's already super confusing,0
I've known him for about 6 months,0
But this is our first time hanging out,0
"Like I've known OF him but I haven't really gotten the chance to know him, ya know?",0
"Haha, gottcha.",0
"Boy, not going to summer term? Well, he's got to pay for his mission somehow.",0
Haha yeah but his parents are really well off so I don't know what the deal is. I'll convince him to come and you can meet him hahaha,0
Do you go on dates?,0
Yes! And then I can tell him that he needs to get some priorities straight.,0
Haha yes,0
Well...let's put it this way.,0
"I was very anti-boy when I was in middle school for whatever reason, and that didn't really translate well into high school. So by the time I figured out that hey, I should",0
"probably have some guy friends, people already knew me as ""that girl who doesn't like guys"" which is completely false, I just don't show it as much as some hyper active",0
girls at my school,0
"Literally my first date, was to senior prom. And that was just as friends. Haha, because I managed to make guy friends this year.",0
Haha well that's awesome I'm proud of toy,0
You,0
*wipes tear* Thank you,0
Have you been on many?,0
Hahaha I've never really hated boys but I'm just that sisterish friend that nobody wants to date,0
And I'm also six feet tall,0
And immensely talented in many areas so that probably affects it too,0
And I want to be a doctor,0
So I'm scary but in a good way,0
"Haha, so if I stood next to you, I would be the one asking how the weather is up there.",0
Hahaha yeah I get that a lot,0
"Ah, that's rough. Is this boy also talented? No, more important question: how tall is he?",0
"Haha he plays volleyball better than me and he's like 6'3"" haha",0
But I suuuuuucck at volleyball so that threshold isn't too hard to pass,0
But I'm talented in weird things,0
I can lick my nose,0
I've always wanted to be able to do that.,0
I can play the piano,0
And do the worm,0
YES!!!,0
AND juggle,0
Double YEES,0
Triple YEEES!,0
Hahahaha thanks I'm pretty satisfied with where I'm at in life,0
"I feel so bad for all these guys who COULD be dating this super rad superstar but alas, they feel insufficient",0
"I don't actually have any evidence, I might just be ugly lol",0
"I would definitely be happy at that point. Yes, what is wrong with these guys? Your date must be the rare breed that can see talent.",0
Shame on the rest of them.,0
Haha I actually asked him haha,0
"Ah, but he said yes.",0
I've been asked on like 3 dates and been on 25ish,0
So my stats are good,0
Ish,0
"Yeah, that would put on the board.",0
Haha I never know if they're just being nice or actually want to go with me,0
"As my mom would say: ""Such is the dating game""",0
And such is the great tragedy of my life,0
"Eh, don't worry. You're ahead in the game, as opposed to others, like my sad socially awkward self.",0
*hipster sigh*,0
You don't want to be ahead in the game?,0
Or was that disappointment in my sad socially awkward self?,0
Haha nah it makes me seem jaded and mean when I say that high school romantic relationships are 100% garbage and that they never last and it's completely pointless so you migh,0
T as well meet as many people as possible,0
And learn about yourseld,0
Yourself,0
"I am 100% agreeing with you. No judging, but my favorite school holiday is Valentine's Day b/c I get to watch couples spend a hecking lot of money and then break up soon after",0
Learning about yourself is important before you learn someone else's life story,0
YES. FILL UP YOUR CUP BEFORE YOU USE YOUR CUP TO FILL OTHERS IT JUST MAKES,0
SENSE,0
Haha yeah I know someone whos girlfriend broke up with him literally 2 days before and he had all this stuff he was going to give her,0
And I was just internally laughing the whole time I felt supremely evil,0
Don't you just love feeling supremely evil?,0
"Huh, I like that cup metaphor. I gotta use that somewhere.",0
Haha only if I know I know better than other people,0
Yeah the sister missionaries told me about it,0
But they were referring to scripture study in the morning haha,0
Sign of a great mind: translating gospel advice to real life situations.,0
Do you plan on going on a mission?,0
Yeah I've got to wait until October 2019...,0
Holy guac ARE YOU AND OCTOBER B-DAY TOO?,0
Haha yes!,0
October for the win. And you're on the younger spectrum too!,0
Yeah did you start school early?,0
"Yeah. They were going to have me take a test to see if I was smart enough, in first grade, then they kind of forgot and I just stayed in the grade.",0
Haha aw sorry,0
But it sucks because I'm going summer term and I'll be 17 the whole time,0
And this may be a stretch.....,0
But I don't think college guys are super into people who can't even buy fish....,0
"But it's all good, I'm down with being repulsive for a year because I'm going on a mission anyways",0
Do you know if you want to go on a mission?,0
Can't buy fish?....what?,0
"I want to go on a mission, but I'm still a little on the fence. So I'll go to college and think about it before I hit 19",0
Oh haha you have to be 18 to be able certain species of pet fish,0
So are you turning 19 this fall?,0
Really? What kind of fish? I wish. It'll be next October. I'll have a whole grandiose year to think about it.,0
Haha yeah all that time... An eternity...,0
I wish I could go a week after graduation like all these boys I know,0
I feel like if I were one of them I'd be even more done with school than I am now.,0
Do you know where some of them are going?,0
Because you learn to work really hard on your mission and everyone comes back and is like college is sooo easy compared to my super hard mission,0
"Yeah the guy I'm going on a date with is going to Pennsylvania, Spanish speaking",0
I know someone going to Philippines and another is going to Bolivia I think,0
I don't know about any of my friends from Oregon though.,0
Hey Pennsylvania! I could hop the border and grill him for you!,0
Hahaha ok sounds good,0
"Phillipines! We have a couple people in my branch who served there, and they just got a temple",0
"Bolivia sounds cool, haven't met anyone who served there yet.",0
Haha yeah we have so many seminary students at my school and they're all going so many different places it's cool,0
Because you're in...AZ? Right...?,0
Haha yeah,0
My school is the biggest feeder school to byu outside of Utah,0
"Like q,wp",0
Whoops,0
"1,200 seminary students",0
Which was absolutely insane coming from Oregon where we had 45 and that was HUGE for the area,0
HOLY GUAC! WHAT EVEN?!?!?! 1200? How many kids are in your grade?,0
"Wow, even 45 is large. Super large.",0
We have...5 at our school. Oh wonderful early morning seminary,0
770 is my graduating class,0
It's craaazy,0
Wow. And I thought my class was big. Graduation's going to take forever!,0
And my old schools graduation rate was like 55% and it's in the 90s here,0
Yeah it's going to take SO LONG,0
You are all geniuses. That will be sweating through the ceremony.,0
Are you at school now?,0
Haha yeah I just skipped my last class because I'm finished with all my projects for it,0
"Now I'm at the church building down the street using the wifi so I can use my laptop, not my phone",0
which is currently dead,0
What kind of classes are you taking right now?,0
"Mrgh, that's so nice that you can just pop into the church straight from school.",0
"I'm taking mostly IB classes (Literature, History of the Americas, Computer Science, Biology), AP stats, a guitar class, and gym.",0
My condolences towards your phone.,0
What classes did you take?,0
Whoah you work so hard haha,0
"I'm taking ap macroecon, ap gov, ap lit, and ap bio, and dance, econ, seminary, and student council",0
But I didn't take the ap exam for any of them so I'm just coasting these last few weeks,0
haha my bad I said econ twice,0
I meant clothing.,0
"Ugh, hard work it was. Except for now. Because we're not doing ANYTHING! Student council is a class? They offer dance? And clothing....?",0
That's the class I skipped. I finished my ridiculous shirt yesterday,0
Like an FC science class?,0
No you just sew a bunch of projects,0
Like I made these really cool navy blue and white gingham pants so catch me on campus rockin those babies,0
Haha and our dance program is ama-zing,0
"Wow, I wish we had a clothing option!",0
I've taken dance for 15 years and I'm still only in the middle class. The people at my school are inhuman,0
The most we have is the sewing machine in the Makerspace in the school library,0
What kind of dance? Everything?,0
Yeah a LOT of contemporary and a little bit of ballet and hip hop,0
Oh that's what we work on at schoo,0
school,0
I did almost entirely modern ballet. And I did ballroom for a few years before I moved to az,0
That's so cool! When you say inhuman...how so? Do you have a lot of pop and lockers? Do you plan on doing dance at BYU?,0
Haha everyone is just so high achieving. In everything. Like I know a sophomore who just ran a 5:30 mile at state and won her race,0
and I know the best harpist in the state and the valedictorian and these people are just sooo good at what they do,0
I'm thinking I might join the social dance club or something haha or I'll take a dance class in the fall.,0
But I guess theres still time to sign up for classes and I could take a ballroom class if I wanted to,0
for summer,0
"Geez, sophomores. I'm good at sports, but I struggle so hard to run straight miles. Ooh, a harpist, that's cool.",0
Haha yeah she's the coolest person I know,0
She's in a band with a bunch of other people I know and they aren't that good but its still impressive that they've made a band,0
"I would've been valedictorian if our high schools hadn't been combined, eh, but such is life.",0
Impressive for a harp in a band. Nice!,0
Agh that is so frustrating. I'm sorry,0
"Yeah, but eh. I have now lost the ability to care about class ranks. One of the many symptoms of senioritis",0
Haha same,0
Do you know what other clubs you might join?,0
Haha I've made a list theres so many,0
Theres a cool prosthetics club I'm interested in,0
Also the skiing/snowboarding one for the fall and winter. I'm taking my skiis and gear with me,0
And some medical volunteering stuff for med school applications,0
Hm. What do you do in a prosthetics club? Skiing! That's so cool! I really want to learn to snowboar.d,0
Oh and theres an anti human trafficking club I want to participate in,0
I really don't know what I would do in the prosthetics club haha,0
It just seems really interesting and I want to learn more about it,0
ugh snowboarders *spits*,0
"Good choice. Haha, snowboarders out there got an interesting reputation?",0
Well,0
My skiis are designed for groomed snow,0
and freaking snowboarders just scoot down the mountain and ruin the snow and expose all these icy patches,0
and its exceedingly frustrating,0
Also getting on and off of lifts with snowboarders SUCKS becauase they have to do this weird limp thing and shimmy along and sometimes fall,0
But I totally support your decision nonetheless haha don't let my biased narrative hold you back from followin those dreams,0
Snowboarding is better than no snow,0
"True true. I went cross country skiing once, which exciting for the first 10 minutes, but also probably the safe choice because I might've died doing any other kind of skiing.",0
Hahaha yeah I have a friend who literally pizza slices his ENTIRE WAY down the mountain like I'm not sure if he can really turn he just goes for it.,0
I started doing jumps this last time I went skiing and it was sooooo fun,0
I was THIS close to joining the ski team my sophomore year but I didn't and I kinda regret that,0
"If I meet you on campus, you must show me videos of you jumping",0
Haha funny story,0
So I was skiing with my dad,0
and  I was doing this tree trail jump and I was like hey dad you go ahead on this one and take a video of me,0
and he was taking video and stuff waiting for me to come down and rip it up,0
and his phone dies RIGHT before I did the jump and it was my best one of the day,0
So on the next run I was like hey its ok just use my phone to do it and my phone was at lik e40%,0
Wow. Talk about bad timing.,0
"and so we did the same thing, he's waiting for me at the jump ready to capture it",0
AND MY PHONE FREAKING DIES RIGHT BEFORE,0
So we were like ok heavenly father must be trying to say something I should probably stop doing jumps for the day haha,0
Hmm. I think your phone has a dying problem.,0
That's really really horribly bad timing.,0
At least you manged to put a silver lining to it.,0
"Haha yeah so if you meet me, I will have no evidence. I'm a fraud. A fake.",0
No proof of my skillz,0
What's the craziest thing you've ever done?,0
Oh dear. I never know what to answer for this one...,0
I guess...I licked the bottom of my friend's shoe once on a dare,0
HAHAHA thats amazing.,0
That IS pretty crazy,0
Phew I'm glad you don't think it was super nasty,0
"I'm sure I've done plenty of other wacko stuff, but I can't think of anything else",0
Haha I've done so much gross stuff its hard to determine the alpha experience,0
Ooh do tell,0
I ate a freeze dried meal worm the other day for NO REASON.,0
I also ate a lego,0
And a penny,0
And not when I was like 2 like everyone else this was ALL WITHIN THE LAST 6 MONTHS,0
ON PURPOSE,0
I applaud you,0
I've always wanted to try a worm/insect,0
Though why did you have freeze dired worms?,0
"Haha they were for my cousin's hedgehog, amadeus",0
They kinda tasted like beef jerky.,0
Kinda smokey,0
His name is Amadeus. That is amazing.,0
Smoky huh?,0
I should go buy some now,0
I like smoky flavors,0
Haha yes he's precious.,0
Haha yeah and crunchy.,0
I'd probably do it again,0
You are all prepared to serve some South American mission,0
Are there any foods you don't like?,0
I don't really know of any...,0
how about you?,0
hey whats up GIRL,0
besides Tithing I would say I would donate to some environmental stuff,0
YOOO,0
wow first chat of the day and it's with my main mans,0
NICE,0
idk groups are so sketchy,0
like,0
if i wanna give money i wanna know EXACTLY where it's goin,0
yeah right????,0
the church is pretty reliable,0
but liKE,0
I feel really skeptical to this groups and non profits because I don't know where the moeny is going exactly,0
exactly!,0
you don't know who's pocketing your money and how much actually goes into the cause,0
"like ""research"" groups sketch me out SO much",0
because who's really holding them to releasing true information,0
like what if they're witholding things to get more money yknow,0
yeah totally. Its pretty dumb. I also don't like to give homeless people cash. When I was younger I saw this man who was lame up in SLC city creek right?,0
and after i got done shopping we started to drive home and I saw the same man walking and running and smoking a cigarette,0
uhggghhhg,0
and I was like I am never again going to give homeless people cash.,0
yeah I don't know if i would give them cash,0
I grew up with that mentality too like give to the poor,0
but like,0
they can't eat food and I can give them better food than the money i'm giving them,0
you still there?,0
Yes,0
"I wonder why it is called ""catfishing""",0
I would love to give one on the growth mindset versus the fixed mindset,0
Have you ever heard about either of those psychology terms?,0
I would probably talk about international teaching and inderstanding culture,0
Oh oops typo,0
"I have actually, both of them. Was there a talk recently about those mindsets",0
?,0
Yes I had to watch one for one of my classes! It was so interesting,0
Why would you talk about those things,0
Haha I have a friend in that same class. I'm currently in a class with a Chinese professor and he doesn't quite understand American culture so it's sometimes hard because he a,0
Assumes we know things that we dont,0
Like what things?? Does he assume?,0
"we know certain math tricks or about ""broadly known"" theorems and formulas and little math tricks",0
What were your takeaways from the mindset video?,0
Still there?,0
this isn't the craziest but once i was standing on the back of my friends car and she started driving and i fell off the back and onto the concrete,0
and i rolled a few times ,0
"What the heck, why?",0
That is so crazy,0
i didn't know she was going to start driving,0
hahaha,0
i just put my retainers in my mouth for the first time in a while and it hurts so much,0
i guess i hung onto the luggage rack on my friends car while he drove around and tried to shake me off,0
it was crazy,0
i felt like i was holding on for my life literally,0
 hahaha that's so funny,0
i'm watching napoleon dynamite,0
oh thats fun,0
such a good movie,0
You think so?,0
hello?,0
hey! i'd say mine is procrastinating at least right now anyways haha,0
Hello?,0
Hi! How are you doing today?,0
I guess it's night time. How are you doing tonight?,0
Just got back from a 2.5 astronomy class so...tired?,0
Haha wow that is a long class! Why is it so late? Do you look at the stars?,0
No kidding. That's just the time it was offered that I could take it. Kind of? We're in the planetarium in the ESC,0
Yeah I understand. Thats still a late class though. I can't imagine there even being a professor who wants to stay up that late teaching. But I guess there is.,0
I've never been in there. Is it pretty cool?,0
Well...Professor is a little crazy...but she's great.  I mean it's only once a week so it's not that bad.,0
Yeah thats not that bad. So are you an astronomy major or are you just taking the class for fun?,0
"Definitely. At least the planetarium. I don't have any other classes in there. She can show basically anything on the planetarium: star motions, planetary motions, supernova",0
"simulations, etc.",0
"Haha I used to want to, but I'm an English major",0
(...soon to be switching to an Editing major...),0
Oh I see that really cool! Do they do like demonstrations in there and stuff? I think I heard they have shows but I've never gone. Would you say they are worth going to?,0
And that's cool that youre an english/editing major! That is a good skill!,0
Yes! They do have shows. I would definitely say yes...as long as you're one of those people that can stay awake in a warm dark room with reclining chairs...,0
Haha thanks. It'll be interesting. Glad that I found out that Editing is now a major.,0
Hmmmm I don't know if that's me I would probably fall asleep honestly.,0
Yeah Editing is cool! I mean I would never want to do it because I would get bored but I understand that it's a lot of work and probably one of the more important aspects of,0
putting together a book or a movie or anything for that matter.,0
What type of editing do you want to do?,0
Basically me...everytime she turns off the lights for the planetarium I'm out.,0
Haha true that.,0
"I mean, I really like science too, so maybe something for National Geographic or other science magazines, for adults or kids. Maybe helping in a museum advertising area",0
Editing fiction/fantasy books would be pretty awesome too though,0
Seriously haha it's so hard when you are so tired all the time because school is a beast and then you just find yourself in a nice dark room.,0
I feel asleep in a microbiology lab once. So if I can sleep there I would definitely be out in the planatarium.,0
Oh thats cool!,0
I hope you get into the program and find a fun job! Do you have to apply to the program or do you just do it?,0
Right? I literally fall asleep everywhere. It's a blessing and a curse.,0
"Kind of? I have to fill out an application to switch, but I'm not sure if that's because it's so new or because it's really competitive, or some other reason...",0
well there is an application to switch majors in general. Maybe it's that.,0
But I don't know for sure.,0
How long have you been at BYU?,0
Probably hope that one. Hope it's not as competitive as the medical programs...,0
Haha one semester. Fresh out of HS,0
Nice. How are you liking it so Far?,0
Pretty good! It's different being on campus and living without parents though...but the experience has been good to meet a bunch of new people,0
Yeah thats awesome! I remember my first semester. It was a blast. Has there been anything that has been difficult to adjust to or anything you wish you knew before coming?,0
"...not really? I feel like everything that has been ""hard"" is just things that come with the personal experience and can't really be specifically warned about.",0
Probably finding a social group? Though I play a lot of Ultimate so I guess that counts,0
What do you think can't be specifically warned about? Anything in particular? (I'm asking because I'm sort of working on a website to help with this).,0
But thats cool that you play ultimate. I played ultimate in high school all the time. It's so fun.,0
"Ohhh, ok. Let me think...uh, I guess just little things like how to adjust to church (I come from a really small branch with a much wider age range),  how organize the fridge,",0
"Organizing time, eating healthy... choosing to go home between classes or staying on campus...whether to do intramurals or clubs or both or neither",0
Ultimate is the best! Were you on a team or club? Or just with friends?,0
Okay! Thanks for the feedback! Yeah I'm working on Something right now just on the side. I don't have that much content yet but I have a few things up.,0
I just played with friends.,0
Is it for a class?,0
No it's just for fun and to help. I've been at BYU a while and Iwant to help people that are newer to have a good experience.,0
Anyway. I have to go now! I have a lot of homework to do. but It was nice chatting!,0
hello?,0
Hi!,0
Is it working?,0
yes,0
hahaha,0
Oh good,0
So how was your break?,0
it was much needed,0
Glad you got some rest,0
I got some too and it was nice,0
oh good!,0
i think that I need more rest but I need to stay really ahead so that I can  have a peace of mind,0
So what are you doing?,0
I am sitting  on my couch and watching Korean TV with my mom and chatting hahaha,0
Oh hahaha nice! What's the show?,0
I am watching a show called the Timeless Song,0
What's it about?,0
It doesn't have a premise or a story line. This show brings in singers and music artists to the stage and have them sing and compete with each other by having them to sing,0
classic and really hard songs.  This episode they are singing the American Classics by Billy Joel. This show got very popular that they were able to bring in very famous,0
artists from the US to have them be a judge for a couple episodes and it was really  surprising,0
Do you know a artist West Life?,0
No hahaha,0
yeah I don't really know him either but he is famous for covering Josh Groban's You Raise me Up,0
and some other songs,0
Oh cool!,0
yeah he is on the show right now and he is judging the korean singers after they perform their own twist of that song,0
Are they singing well?,0
yeah its pretty good. I love this show because it never really has K Pop stars but they bring  in solo artists and underground artist who actually has a great voice unlike  a,0
a lot of the K Pop stars just only have looks and they can't really sing or anything and they just practice dancing 24/7,0
K pop stars also get a lot of plastic surgery too and its pretty sad actually,0
Korea is the number one in use of plastic surgery for just aesthetics,0
Really?,0
yeah,0
its not good.,0
but oh well,0
a lot of the koreans are very conscious about their looks because the korean TV shows and the Media drives a lot of the fashion and the pop culture their and everyone is alway,0
glued to it,0
Is that something that is good or bad about the culture there?,0
hmmmm well i think there are pros and cons about this,0
I think that it is really important,0
hello?,0
hey you there?,0
yeah,0
sorry I had to reset the chat,0
ok no problem,0
so back to your question I think that it has pros and cons,0
some of the pros i think is that these TV shows are really watched by literally everyone because the TV really connects the people. If there is a K drama that is number one on,0
TV then everyone watches and they connect with each other,0
on a quick side note: West life is actually really really famous,0
their songs are very famous and I never really knew their name hahaha,0
hahaha yeah I tend to remember the songs,0
yeah totally it happens to me all the time,0
So anyway,0
another pro I think is that the media on TV in korea is pretty uplifting and a lot of them have good morals and happy messages and the populars are pretty clean and things,0
like that the media helps the society understand what is good and what is not and many young people and children and adults want to follow that,0
hmm yeah I feel that. I feel like there are so many terrible things in America that it does not help the scoiety,0
yeah i feel you there,0
what are some cons?,0
hmm I think a con is that a lot of people get too caught up with the dramas and they wish the things in the dramas to happen to them in real life and many people can develop,0
false expectations in their real lives and it causes them to be ungrateful,0
oh wow interesting,0
yeah I can see that happening,0
its like the social media,0
yes exactly,0
there was a time when there was a show called the Descendent of the Sun and the main character was so nice to the girlfriend and was the PERFECT man for anyone. this show was,0
number one in Korea and that means that basically everyone in Korea and their dogs watches it,0
a lot of women there developed this expectation of their husbands to be like the main character in the show and because they compared them these women thought that they were,0
being treated unfairly so they divorced their husbands.  I don't know if they  just expected for their husbands to be like the character or if it helped them find some terribl,0
quality and trait in their husbands that hey divorced him,0
maybe it was a combination of both,0
yeah maybe it is a combination of both,0
so do you have any favorite korean dramas or tv shows?,0
yeah actually i do,0
give me some suggestions and the plot,0
Well there is this drama called Goblin. There is this really beautiful love story that makes your heart melt.,0
"To not give away too much, basically the main character was cursed thousands of years ago because he killed people and never learned to love",0
His curse was that he would never die and see the people he cared about grow old and pass away,0
That sounds interesting!,0
Does the goblin have a way to break the cruse?,0
"The Goblin needs to find his ""wife"" who will love him and can see the sword the Gobin killed people with.",0
That is how he knows that is his wife.,0
It sounds a little weird but it is such an amazing story,0
I got so invested into it.,0
Do you only watch K dramas?,0
No I like to watch American TV shows too1,0
Have you seen The Office?,0
Of course! The Office is a classic.,0
The characters are hilarious and the director of the show is a clever genius.,0
I also really like Modern Family. Have you seen that show?,0
Yes I have!,0
I'm not a die hard fan but I watch it from time to time,0
They have a lot of good episodes but which one is your favorite?,0
I agree! They have really good episodes.,0
I really like the one where Jae and Manny makes fun of Gloria for not being able to understand jokes and takes things too seriouslu,0
But she pranks them really bad by inviting a neighborly worker home and lets him know the plan.,0
This man she invites looks very much like her son Manny.,0
Joe thinks that he is meeting one of Gloria's Ex.,0
"So when the man comes to visit, Jae realizes how they look so much a like an starts getting worried",0
Oh yea! I remember that epsiode,0
Gloria pranks them really good.,0
Which one is your favorite character and why?,0
Oh that is a hard one!,0
I really like all the Characters!,0
They all have grown on me and I feel like I almost know them personall,0
personally,0
I have been a die hard fan of this show for most my childhood and still am!,0
That is so cool!,0
I really like watching the bachelor. Have you seen it?,0
No I have not.,0
My sister is a fan of that show and I know what the show is about.,0
It isn't really my thing.,0
Ya I understand.,0
Most people don't like it,0
I just watch to make fun of it.,0
So I am guessing you mostly like comedy shows?,0
I like comedy but not just that.,0
I like a good action movie as well!,0
I don't know if you have ever seen the bourne series?,0
But that one is one of my favorites because the story line is amazing but the action fighting scenes are out of control!,0
I used to really want to know how to fight. I think it would be so cool .,0
I think it would be as well.,0
I am a fan of boxing and take classess.,0
have you boxed before?,0
Yes I have actually but just with friends as a joke.,0
I am no where close to be good!,0
Are you pretty good?,0
I wouldn't say I am a pro but I am good enough to win a match1,0
What other activies do you like besides boxing?,0
I really like rock climbing,0
nice1,0
1,0
Is rock climbing hard?,0
When I first started it kind of was. But I started to get really good at it.,0
It's been hard to find time to go climb because of school and work..,0
But when I do have free time I try to go.,0
That is so cool!,0
"I understand, finding time to do what you like is hard.",0
"School, part time job, dating, if you go to church.... lots of things to balance.",0
How do you find time to balance out everything?,0
to be honest it is really hard.,0
Before I would try to have done everything I can do climb and hang out with friends but I get so tired now .,0
whenever I have free time I prefer to take a break and nap.,0
This week I think I have gotten maybe 3~4 hours of sleep.,0
That is crazy1,0
1,0
!,0
I am so sorry to hear you have been getting very little sleep,0
You don't need to be sorry! It had been okay and I am still alive.,0
I feel like this is just life and I have so many things to be happy about.,0
"But still, getting another hour or two of sleep would be nice!",0
Would you say this is the hardest time of your life?,0
I wouldn't say this had been the hardest.,0
"It definetly has been hard but compared to the other hardships I have gone through in my life, this is pretty easy and doesn't really compare.",0
you seem like one tough cookie,0
What makes you stay optimitic?,0
Remember all the blessings I have received in my life had helped me stay optimistic and know that everything is going to be alright,0
Having positive people around you who encourage you and support you are also very important.,0
It will be hard if you have people who are not.,0
Who would you say had been the most influential?,0
I would have to say my mom.,0
"I know that is a very basic question, ""my hero is my mom"" but it is the truth!",0
My mother is who I aspire to be. She is one of the greatest examples to me.,0
She sounds amazing!,0
"speaking of mothers, it is mothers day tommorrow!",0
what are you going to do for your mother?,0
That is right! It is mother's day tomorrow!,0
I am going to make chicken scampi pasta and cookies.,0
My mothers favorite dish!,0
"I wish I could do more but as a broke college student, there isn't much I can do.",0
hey that is okay!,0
you are probaly an amazing cook.,0
"I am not s 5 star chef, no way. But I do like to cook and make people happy.",0
Did you learn how to cook by yourself?,0
"Yes and no. Simple basic things I learned by myself but if one day I felt like eating thai curry, youtube taught me.",0
I wish I knew how to cook.,0
"You can, cook.",0
It is really easy and simple.,0
